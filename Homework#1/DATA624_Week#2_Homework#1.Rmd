## DATA 624 Predictive Analytics

### Homework #1: Time Series Graphics & Exploration

#### In this homework assignment, we were given the task to complete exercies 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.8 from the Hyndman online FOrecasting book. In these exercises, we are able to explore time series data.

### Housekeeping

```{r}
library(fpp3)
```


### Exercise #2.1

```{r}
?aus_production
```

- **Explanation:** By using this command, I am able to open up the "help" documentation for 'aus_productions' which gives me details about data set which in return I see that it is 'Quarterly production of selected commodities in Australia' For this specific assignment and exercise, I need to explore 'Bricks' from this dataset which is given the description of 'clay brick production in millions of bricks'
